Python Concentration/Matching Game

This is a game implemented in Python in which the user is required to remember and match characters with
ones that they have previously been shown. They are allowed to flip over 2 positions at a time, of which they then
must remember what they saw in order to match the pairs together. The program ends when the user has matched all the 
pairs. At the start of the game the user has 2 options to choose from, play with a random rigorous deck,
or choose one of the premade decks which are included in this folder (bo1.txt, bo2.txt) etc.
